This code is NOT for odroid, this is for calibration.

Instructions:
1. After running this code, press "space" or "esc" when the target line is completely in the frame. It will pause the video/stream.
2. Now, use trackbars in "control" to set the params.
3. After being convinced with parameters and the result in the "Lines" window, press "esc".
4. A file called "params.txt" will be formed with all the parameters.
5. Copy this file in the folder containing "LineOdroid.cpp" in odroid.
